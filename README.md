## Notebook Overview

The notebook includes the following sections:
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**  
   Load and examine the dataset, exploring key features and distributions.
   
2. **Preprocessing**  
   Prepare data for modeling by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

3. **Modeling with Linear Regression**  
   - Fit a linear regression model to the dataset.
   - Interpret model coefficients and intercept.

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Assess performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
   - Visualize residuals to check model assumptions.
